# AWS BeSA 2026 | Solutions Architecture & Agentic AI Master Lab

A comprehensive technical repository documenting my journey through the **[Become a Solutions Architect (BeSA)](https://besaprogram.com)** 2026 cohort. This "Master Lab" serves as a central hub for architectural patterns, Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) templates, and end-to-end AI implementations.

## 🏗️ Repository Highlights
*   **Agentic AI Suite:** Multi-agent orchestration and RAG implementations using [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com).
*   **Architectural Labs:** Hands-on deployments focusing on the [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com).
*   **Infrastructure-as-Code:** Modular [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) and [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com) patterns for automated resource provisioning.
*   **Whitepapers & Deep Dives:** Summaries and architectural diagrams of complex AWS ecosystem integrations.

## 🎯 Objective
To bridge the gap between cloud engineering and high-level solutions architecture, focusing on the 2026 "Agentic AI" paradigm shift in enterprise cloud computing.
